## Responsability model

AWS follows a shared responsibility model, which defines the responsibilities of both AWS and the customer.

For example:

* AWS is responsible for managing the network, storage, databases, and compute resources.

* You are responsible for securing your data and managing your own configurations. You need to take care of server-side encryption network, firewall and operating system configuration.
