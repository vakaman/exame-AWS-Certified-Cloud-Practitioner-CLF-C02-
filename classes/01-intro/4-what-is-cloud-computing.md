## What is Cloud Computing?  

### Before  

* Before cloud services became common, companies had to manage all infrastructure complexities internally.  
* Servers of various types were maintained in dedicated rooms.  
* These rooms required cooling due to the number of active machines.  
* A significant amount of energy consumption was expected to maintain the infrastructure.  
* Complex and difficult to maintain.  
* High costs, especially for vertical scaling.  

### After  

* Data centers emerged worldwide.  
* We can choose the nearest data center without worrying about disaster recovery.  
* Costs related to power, cooling, networking, and server upgrades are now charged as a service.  
* Easy to scale.  
* Wide range of services available.  
* High availability.

### Advantages  

* Low cost  
* Flexibility  
* Global scale  
* Agility

### Types of Cloud  

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
    * Infrastructure leasing:  
        * Servers  
        * Virtual Machines (VMs)  
        * Storage  
    * These resources focus on computational infrastructure leasing and do not include configuration.  
    * Essentially, it is the outsourcing of hardware resources.  

* **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
    * Leasing of platform resources:  
        * Databases  
        * Website hosting  
        * Pre-configured operating system environments  

* **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
    * Leasing of software application licenses:  
        * Email services  
        * Dropbox  
        * Google Drive  

## Implementations  

### Public Cloud  

Shared hardware resources. Imagine a cluster of servers where multiple customers consume resources on demand or with a specified limit.  
The cloud provider is responsible for security, ensuring that customers cannot access each other's resources, even if they share the same hardware.  

* AWS  
* Azure  
* GCP  

### Private Cloud  

Dedicated hardware resources. Even in a cloud environment, it is possible to contract services where hardware resources are 100% dedicated. Large institutions often adopt this approach.  

* Banks  
* Governments  
* Financial institutions  

### Hybrid Cloud  

A combination of shared and dedicated hardware resources. Some resources remain on shared infrastructure, while others are kept private.
